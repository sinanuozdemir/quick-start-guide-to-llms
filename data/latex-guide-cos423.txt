1    Introduction
LATEX is a document markup language (created by Leslie Lamport) for the TEX typesetting system (created
by Donald Knuth). It is widely used in academia, especially by scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.
It has emerged as the standard way to display mathematics on the Web (e.g., MathJax, Piazza, WordPress,
and Coursera). This document is intended for people who have never used LATEX and want a quick crash
course to get started. For a more comprehensive introduction, check out

                 http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf


2    How to find and use LATEX?
Most Princeton university clusters have LATEX installed. If you prefer, you can install it on your home system;
it is easy to find via your favorite search engine. I recommend using front-end programs such as TEXShop or
TEXworks. Alternatively, you can use a text editor such as emacs (and its LATEX-mode) and the command
line. For simplicity in exposition, we will assume that you are compiling from the command line for the rest
of the guide.


3    Basic rules
Basic LATEX is just text with typesetting commands. Typesetting commands are usually preceded by “\”,
and any arguments are usually placed inside curly braces “{}”.
LATEX wraps text in adjacent lines as if they were part of the same paragraph. To start a new paragraph,
insert an extra “return”:
  Source:                                                 Output:
  This is
  one paragraph.                                           This is one paragraph.
                                                           This is another.
  This is another.

To get a newline without starting a new paragraph, use \\.
To get a comment, use the percent sign % at the beginning of a line. The rest of that particular line will be
commented out.


                                                      1
4      Creating a new document
The most basic document has three parts:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
This is
one paragraph.

This is another.
\end{document}

In practice, you typically create a new document by copying an existing document, deleting the stuff between
the begin and end document commands, and changing some information in the header. In COS 423, you
will use the following template:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos423/latex/problem0-1.tex.


5      Compiling
Suppose our file is named problem0-1.tex. To compile it, invoke pdflatex problem0-1.tex in your Unix
shell. This will compile the file, assuming there are no errors.1 If there are errors, you can quit the compiler by
hitting “x” and then enter. Unfortunately, LATEX compiler errors are often not very unhelpful in determining
the nature of the problem but they usually identify on which line the error occurred.
Once it successfully compiles, you will get a file named mylatexfile.pdf that you can open and view.


6      Organization
It is important to organize your document.


6.1         Sectioning
There are two sectioning commands that will be useful for you: \section{Name of section} and
\subsection{Name of subsection}.


6.2         Tables
You can put stuff into tables by using the tabular environment. For example:
 Source:                                                               Output:
 \begin{tabular}{r|cl}
 1st column & 2nd column & 3rd column\\
                                                                          1st column      2nd column        3rd column
 \hline
                                                                                   a           b            c
 a & b & c
 \end{tabular}
    1 One   quirk is that you may have to invoke latex twice if you are using labels or references. See Section 6.4.


                                                                  2
Note that the command is called tabular and not table. Important points:

    • The “{r|cl}” after the tabular \begin{tabular} indicate the alignment of the three columns: right,
      center, and left. This is mandatory as it specifies the layout of the table. For more columns, type more
      alignment commands, e.g. for a table with 5 columns all aligned to the right, you would use rrrrr.
    • The vertical bar | between the r and c indicates that a vertical line should be drawn between those
      columns.’

    • The & separates the columns in the body of the table.
    • A \\ signifies the end of each line of the table.
    • The command \hline means that a horizontal line should be inserted.


6.3    Lists
You can put stuff into bulleted and enumerated lists by using the enumerate and itemize commands,
respectively. Nesting is allowed. For example:
 Source:                                                      Output:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item This is the first enumerated item.                        1. This is the first enumerated item.
     \begin{itemize}
     \item This is one bullet.                                          • This is one bullet.
     \item This is another bullet.                                      • This is another.
     \end{itemize}
 \item This is the second enumerated item.                       2. This is the second enumerated item.
 \end{enumerate}

6.4    Labels and references
You can refer to a specific section number by using the \label{labelname} command. Place this right
after you start a section. Then, you may refer to the section number by using \ref{labelname}. The same
technique can be used to refer to math equations and theorems.
LATEXcreates and uses a bunch of auxiliary files to support labels and references. Be sure to invoke latex
twice to compile a file that has labels and references (or if thoses labels and references have changed since
the last compilation).


7     Math
The primary reason to use LATEX is its ability to typeset mathematical expressions.


7.1    Math mode
Math expressions are separate from text in LATEX. To enter a math environment in the middle of text, use
the dollar sign $, for example $F = ma$ produces F = ma. Everything between the two $ signs will be
treated as a math formula.


                                                          3
To type a math expression that is on its own line and centered, delimit it with \[ and \]:
 Source:                                                  Output:
 The following is an important equation:                  The following is an important equation:
 \[ E = mc^2 \]
                                                                                 E = mc2

To give an equation a number and have it referable, use the equation environment and use a \label
command:
 Source:                                             Output:
 The following is an important equation:
 \begin{equation}                                     The following is an important equation:
 \label{emc}
                                                                            E = mc2               (1)
 E = mc^2
 \end{equation}                                       Please memorize Equation 1.
 Please memorize Equation \ref{emc}.

To typeset several equations together and have them properly aligned, use the align environment:
  Source:                                                   Output:
  Some important equations:
  \begin{align}
  \label{einstein}                                          Some important equations:
  E & = mc^2 \\
                                                                                  E = mc2                   (2)
  \label{newton}
  F & = ma \\                                                                     F = ma                    (3)
  \label{euler}                                                                   iπ
                                                                                 e = −1                     (4)
  e^{i \pi} & = -1
  \end{align}
The equations are aligned along the & and each line is terminated by \\. To suppress the equation numbering
(i.e. if the equations won’t be referred to) use align* instead of align.


7.2    Writing math expressions
I will only go over a few common mistakes and hard-to-find expressions regarding how to write math ex-
pressions. It is quite intuitive otherwise, you can figure most things out quickly with trial and error. All
expressions in math mode may be nested within each other arbitrarily.

   • Superscript and subscript are done using ^ and _ characters. Note that if you want multiple characters
     in the super/subscript then you need to surround them with curly braces: $e^i\pi = -1$ gives ei π =
     −1 whereas $e^{i\pi} = -1$ gives eiπ = −1.
   • Fractions are done using $\frac{1}{2}$ which gives 12 .
                                                                     n
                                                                         
   • To do a binomial coefficient, use $\binom{n}{k}$ which gives    k       .
   • Modular arithmetic can be written using the \pmod{n} and \bmod{n} commands. The first puts
     parentheses and a lot of space around the mod and the second does not.
   • ∀ and ∃ are written as \forall and \exists.
   • 6=, ≥, and ≤ are written as \neq, \geq, and \leq.


                                                     4
• · (e.g. for multiplication) is \cdot.

• . . . is produced by \ldots and · · · by \cdots (notice the relative height).
• ◦ is \circ.
• ∪, ∩, and \ are \cup, \cap, and \setminus.

• Large ∪ and ∩ signs that behave like summations (see below for summations) are written as \bigcup
  and \bigcap.
• Z, R, etc. are produced using \Z, \R, etc.
• E is produced with \Exp.

• O (n), Ω (n), Θ (n) are produced with \BigO{n}, \BigOmega{n}, and \BigTheta{n}.
• P and NP are produced using \P, \NP, etc.
• ` (as opposed to l) is produced with \ell.
• ≈ is produced with \approx.

• x̂ and x̄ are done with \hat{x} and \bar{x}. A longer bar may be written using \overline{\SAT},
  which produces SAT .
• x0 and x00 are done with x’ and x’’, respectively.
• ε (as opposed to ) may be written with \eps.

• ∈ and ∈
        / are written as \in and \notin.
• Negations may be done with \not, for example \not\geq gives 6≥.
• {0, 1} is abbreviated as \zo.

• The probability sign Pr is defined as \Pr.
• {} are done with \{ and \}.
• To draw parentheses, braces, or brackets that resize to match the contents, use \left to precede the
  left one and \right to precede the right one:
  Source:

  \[ \Pr\left[\sum_{i=1}^k X_i > c \right] \leq 2^{-\Omega(c^2 k)} \]

  Output:                                      "              #
                                                   k
                                                   X                  2
                                          Pr             Xi > c ≤ 2−Ω(c   k)

                                                   i=1

• Arrays are similar to tables, except they must be used in place of tables when in math mode: instead of
  using \begin{tabular} and \end{tabular} use \begin{array} and \end{array}. Again, you must
  give a column specification for how the columns are to be laid out.




                                                          5
    • Spacing is very different in math mode so text in the middle of a formula is set strangely. If you want
      to have text in the middle of the formula, use the \text{some text} command. For example,
      $\P \neq \NP \text{ implies that } \SAT \notin \P$ produces P 6= NP implies that SAT ∈                /
      P.
    • Summations and products are done using \sum and \prod respectively. Parameters can be given for
      the summation/product as well:
       Source:                                               Output:
                                                                                    ∞
                                                                                   X   1
       \[ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} = 1 \]                                        i
                                                                                          =1
                                                                                   i=1
                                                                                       2

    • Piecewise functions may be defined using the piecewise environment:
       Source:                                               Output:
       \[ f(x) = \begin{piecewise}                                                    
       1 & \text{ if } x = 0 \\                                                           1, if x = 0
                                                                            f (x) =
       0 & \text{ if } x \neq 0                                                           0, if x 6= 0
       \end{piecewise} \]
    • You may define new commands using \newcommand{\commandname}{definition}. This is essentially
      a macro, so that whenever \commandname appears, the text of definition is inserted in its place.
      If \commandname is already taken, either use a different name or use \renewcommand{...}{...} to
      overwrite the old definition.
    • There are many many other symbols available. You can search for “latex symbols” online and come
      up with the references.


8     Writing pseudocode
It is often necessary to state pseudocode when dealing with specific algorithms. Two packages that are useful
for writing pseudocode are the algorithm and algorithmcx packages. We use the algorithm environment so
that the code is not across different pages. We use the algorithmcx package to write the specific pseudocode.
An example is presented below.
 Source:                                                  Output:
 \begin{algorithm}[H]
   \caption{Euclid’s algorithm}
   \begin{algorithmic}
     \INPUT $a \ge 0$, $b \ge 0$
                                                           Algorithm 1 Euclid’s algorithm
     \OUTPUT the gcd of $a$ and $b$
                                                           INPUT: nonnegative integers a and b
     \Function{gcd}{$x, y$}
                                                           OUTPUT: the greatest common divisor of a and b
        \If {$b = 0$}
                                                             function gcd(x, y)
          \Return $a$
                                                                if b = 0 then return a
        \Else $\;$
                                                                else return gcd(b, a mod b)
          \Return \Call{gcd}{$b, a \bmod b$}
                                                                end if
        \EndIf
                                                             end function
     \EndFunction
   \end{algorithmic}
 \end{algorithm}

9    Figures
The easiest way to include figures in LATEX is to draw the figure using some other software package (such as
Powerpoint, Keynote, Illustrator, xfig, or Google drawings) and save it as a .pdf file (perhaps after cropping
it to the desired size). We use the graphicx package to import it into our document. Suppose for example,
we have an image pdf file saved in our working directory as “einstein.pdf”. We can use the following code
to include the image in our document.
 Source:                                                                   Output:
 \begin{figure}[p]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{einstein.pdf}
   \caption{Image of Einstein.}
   \label{fig:einstein}
 \end{figure}
